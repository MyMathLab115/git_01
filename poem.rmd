## First Verse 
<!--Put the first five lines of a poem by Lewis Carrol in this section!-->

"The sun was shining on the sea,  
Shining with all his might:  
He did his very best to make  
The billows smooth and bright —  
And this was odd, because it was  


## Second Verse
<!--Put the first five lines of a poem by Robert Frost here!-->

Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,  
And sorry I could not travel both  
And be one traveler, long I stood  
And looked down one as far as I could  
To where it bent in the undergrowth;  

## Third Verse
<!--Put the first two verses of The Walrus and the Carpenter here!-->

"The sun was shining on the sea,  
Shining with all his might:  
He did his very best to make  
The billows smooth and bright —  
And this was odd, because it was  
The middle of the night.  

The moon was shining sulkily,  
Because she thought the sun  
Had got no business to be there  
After the day was done —  
"It's very rude of him," she said,  
"To come and spoil the fun."  

## Last Verse
<!--Put a short poem you created using chatGPT of 20 to 30 lines,here!-->

In a world adorned with stars so bright,  
Where dreams dance freely through the night,  
I wander through the forest green,  
Where secrets whisper and remain unseen.  

Oh, the ocean waves, they crash and roar,  
As they chase the moon along the shore.  
A symphony of nature's grace,  
Painting colors on a canvas of space.  

Through fields of gold, the wild winds blow,  
Guiding me where the wildflowers grow.  
I seek solace in the mountain's embrace,  
Seeking answers in its ancient face.  

The city streets, alive and loud,  
Where dreams are born and hopes are vowed.  
A tapestry of diverse souls,  
Each one playing their unique roles.  

Beneath a canopy of silver trees,  
I find a haven, a gentle breeze.  
Where time stands still, my heart takes flight,  
In a realm of magic, pure and bright.  

Whispers of love float on the breeze,  
As hearts entwine with effortless ease.  
For love knows no bounds or worldly chains,  
It dances freely through life's refrains.  

The sun sets low, casting golden hues,  
As evening paints the sky with vibrant blues.  
And in this moment, I find my peace,  
As nature's wonders never cease.  

From dawn to dusk, a tale unfolds,  
Of life's mysteries and stories untold.  
In every line and verse, a fragment true,  
Of dreams, love, and the world we view.  

So let us wander, hand in hand,  
Through this vast world, both grand and grand.  
With open hearts and eyes that see,  
The beauty of life's tapestry.
